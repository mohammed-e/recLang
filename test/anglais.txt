At the start of the game, the player is placed on the surface of a procedurally generated and virtually infinite game world.[21] The world is divided into biomes ranging from deserts to jungles to snowfields.[22][23] Players can walk across the terrain consisting of plains, mountains, forests, caves, and various water bodies.[21] The in-game time system follows a day and night cycle, with one full cycle lasting 20 real-time minutes. Throughout the course of the game, players encounter various non-player characters known as mobs, including animals, villagers and hostile creatures.[24] Non-hostile animals—such as cows, pigs, and chickens—can be hunted for food and crafting materials, and spawn in the daytime. By contrast, hostile mobs—such as large spiders, skeletons, and zombies—spawn during nighttime or in dark places, such as caves.[21] Some Minecraft-unique creatures have been noted by reviewers, such as the Creeper, an exploding creature that sneaks up on the player; and the Enderman, a creature with the ability to teleport and pick up blocks.[25]
